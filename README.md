I put the title and sub title, and make button to change the title using javascript. I also bring images as a SVG code when hovering over the icons, the colors are changed (using CSS). I bring icon of tomato as a SVG and put the button below the icon so cliking the button, it's loaded your click times. When you minimize the screen, the letter tomato is disappeared right away. (Using CSS)

#I don't know how to bring image as a SVG file in object and give hover reaction to them.
