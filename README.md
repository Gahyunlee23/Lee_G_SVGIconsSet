I put the title and subtitle, and make the button to change the title using javascript. I also bring images as SVG codes, so when hovering over the icons, the colors are changed (using CSS). I bring the icon of tomato as an SVG and put the button below the icon so clicking the button(Using Java), it's loaded your click times. When you minimize the screen, the letter tomato is disappeared right away. (Using CSS)

#I don't know how to bring image as a SVG file in object and give hover reaction to them.
